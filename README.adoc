= vertx-pojo-mapper 
====asynchronously map java objects into datastores and back

vertx-pojo-mapper is a framework for nonblocking pojo mapping for different datasources.
It is styled to master ORM ( object relational mapping ) as well as ODM ( object document mapping ) 

Key features

* nonblocking as far as possible
* mapping java objects into different datasources like Mongo-DB, MySql etc.
* transparent and flexible markup for POJOs
* extensible type conversion
* fluent api
* very fast initialization

defines the common interfaces and default implementations for all particular implementations

* link:vertx-pojo-mapper-json/README.adoc[vertx-pojo-mapper-json]
Contains common implementations of vertx-pojo-mapper-common for all those particular solutions, which are using JSON as 
a format to serialize Java objects

* link:vertx-pojongo/README.adoc[vertx-pojongo]
This is the concrete implementation of vertx-pojo-mapper, which is using MongoDB as datastore
