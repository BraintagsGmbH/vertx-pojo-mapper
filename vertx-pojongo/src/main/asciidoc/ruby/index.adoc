== Implementation of pojo mapper for Mongo

We provide an implementation of `link:unavailable[IDataStore]` which uses the Vert.x `link:../../vertx-mongo-client/ruby/yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html[MongoClient]`
to perform mapping of POJOs into the datastore

To create an instance you first need an instance of `link:../../vertx-mongo-client/ruby/yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html[MongoClient]`.

To learn how to create one, please consult the documentation for the MongoClient.

Once you've got one, you can create an instance of `link:unavailable[IDataStore]`, which deals with MongoDB,
as follows:

[source,java]
----
require 'vertx-mongo/mongo_client'
config = {
}
config['connection_string'] = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
config['db_name'] = "PojongoTestDatabase"
mongoClient = VertxMongo::MongoClient.create_non_shared(vertx, config)
mongoDataStore = Java::DeBraintagsIoVertxPojomapperMongo::MongoDataStore.new(mongoClient)

----

The rest of the usage is the same than described in the documentation of link:../vertx-pojo-mapper-common[vertx-pojo-mapper-common]
